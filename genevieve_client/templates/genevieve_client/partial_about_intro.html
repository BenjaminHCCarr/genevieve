  Genevieve is a window into what researchers might find if they analyzed your
  genetic data. Specifically, Genevieve basically does two things:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Genevieve matches your genome against the ClinVar database.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/intro/">ClinVar</a> is a
      public archive of genetic variants and their reported effects on disease
      and health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve also draws on allele frequency data from the
      <a href="http://exac.broadinstitute.org/">Exome Aggregate
      Consortium (ExAC)</a>. ClinVar and ExAC data are retrieved from
      <a href="http://myvariant.info/">MyVariant.info API</a>, an open source
      server hosting variant information from various databases.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Genevieve allows users to add and edit shared notes.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      User-generated notes can help clarify and expand on the information
      contained in ClinVar. You can contribute to this shared understanding!
      Genevieve's notes are public domain (CC0), and are publicly available via
      the GenNotes server API.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Genevieve does not provide ancestry reports. Also, Genevieve does not attempt
  to assess any combined effects arising from a combination of different
  genetic variants.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Genevieve reports are dynamic.</b> The shared notes on Genevieve are
  constantly subject to change, and the databases Genevieve draws upon are
  expected to update regularly.
